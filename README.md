# Base1101 | Millecentunius or Millecentunimal
Base1101 is a numerical system designed specifically for handling numbers that exceed one billion digits in length. While it doesn't have a straightforward conversion to other bases, any number expressed in BaseN can be accurately represented in Base1101. However, converting from BaseN to Base1101 and then a different BaseN would not yield the correct translation. The only direct correlation that exists is between Base1101 and another base is Base10, as they both increment numbers in the same manner, following the principles of a typical number system.

Base 10 raised to its base is 10^10 = 11 digits;

Base 1101 raised to its base is 1101^1101 = 3500 digits.
